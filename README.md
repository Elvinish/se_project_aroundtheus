**Intro**

This project 3 was made using Vs code acoording on Figma with images. In my project I have Page, Header, Main section and footer. In the header I used logo, in the main section i put profile where we have edit button and add button, so far I have images where the the person was traveled, and footer. for made this web site pesponsive I used grid container. I gave size to all part of blocks, titles. I used max-width, to make a page more responsive and not sticking to each other. I used margins, paddings to make elements more orginized. Also I have added the hover statement, to make buttons are looking different when hover on it. I used grid-template-colums to ristrict with 375px elements. We can see aling items function to sentered elements which looks more better to view. There are some grid-gaps between the columns. For mobile view I added media query and added some changes for title, profile, footer when it comes to mobile sizes. Then we can see on the card description the words fit inside the card or its continiue with dats, for that i used text overflow and overflow with hidden vallue.
